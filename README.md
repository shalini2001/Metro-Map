# METRO RAIL APP

This Java program facilitates commuters by providing fare information and the shortest metro route between source and destination stations in the Delhi Metro. Additionally, it includes a metro map for enhanced navigation.

The application leverages Graph and Heap data structures. Nodes in the graph represent metro stations, containing details like station name, corridor, and connected lines. Edges denote the distance between stations, with edge costs equivalent to the distance between connecting stations.

Utilizing algorithms such as Dijkstra, breadth-first search, and depth-first search, the program computes the shortest path and fare between source and destination stations based on total distance traveled. The resulting metro route and fare are then displayed.

REQUIREMENTS

The project is compatible with various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse, Netbeans, and ideone.com.
Basic knowledge of Java Programming is recommended.
Familiarity with data structures (Graph, Heap) and algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS) is advantageous but not mandatory.
Understanding of the Java Collection framework is beneficial, but not essential. (For reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/)
